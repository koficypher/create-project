# Typescript Template

Just like any typescript project you will have to run `npm run build` to build your `.ts` files into
`.js` in your specified `dir` in the `tsconfig.json`.

To have a live reload or rebuild anytime you make change to your `.ts` files run `npm run watch` in a separate terminal before you continue to develop.
